# 💻 IDE vs CLI Tools (2025 Overview)

This README explains the **difference between IDE and CLI tools**, lists **popular platforms**, and highlights their **uses in modern software development**.

---

## 🧠 What Are IDE and CLI Tools?

- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**:  
  A graphical tool used for **writing, debugging, and managing code** in a complete environment.  

- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**:  
  A **text-based tool** that executes commands directly in the terminal for **automation, configuration, and system control**.

## ⚖️ Key Differences Between IDE and CLI Tools

| **Feature** | **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** | **CLI (Command Line Interface)** |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Definition** | GUI-based application for software development. | Text-based interface for executing commands. |
| **User Interface** | Graphical (menus, buttons, panels). | Text-based (typed commands). |
| **Ease of Use** | Easy for beginners, intuitive UI. | Requires knowledge of commands. |
| **Performance** | Heavier, consumes more memory. | Lightweight and faster. |
| **Automation** | Built-in tools for testing and debugging. | Script-based automation and chaining. |
| **Customization** | Visual plugins and extensions. | Fully customizable with scripts. |
| **Best For** | Writing, testing, and managing projects. | Deployment, automation, and DevOps tasks. |
| **Examples** | VS Code, PyCharm, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA | AWS CLI, Gemini CLI, GitHub CLI, FFmpeg |
