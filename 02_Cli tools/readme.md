# 🚀 Modern CLI Tools Overview (2025)

This document gives a complete overview of **modern CLI (Command-Line Interface) tools** — their purpose, active development trends, major AI model CLIs, and company adoption insights.

---

## 📘 1. What Are CLI Tools?

**CLI (Command-Line Interface) tools** allow users to interact with software directly from the terminal.  
They help automate workflows, manage systems, and integrate AI into developer pipelines.

Modern CLIs now combine **traditional DevOps control** with **AI-powered automation**, enabling natural-language coding, code generation, testing, and cloud management — all from your terminal.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Modern Uses of CLIs (Today’s Workflows)

| Use Case | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🧠 **AI-Powered Coding** | CLIs like Gemini, Codex, Claude, and Qwen can write or refactor code using AI models. |
| ☁️ **Cloud & Infrastructure Automation** | Tools like `aws`, `gcloud`, and `pulumi` manage servers, databases, and deployments. |
| 💡 **Developer Productivity** | CLIs simplify Git operations, test automation, and code review tasks. |
| 🧩 **Agentic AI Integration** | Modern CLIs embed AI agents that understand repos and take actions. |

---

## 🤖 3. “Vibe Coding” (AI-Assisted / Wipe Coding)

**Vibe coding** means coding through *intent*, not syntax — developers describe what they want in plain English, and AI tools generate or modify the code automatically.

It represents the **next generation of CLI work**:
- Fast AI-driven refactoring.
- Code understanding and documentation.
- Automated test generation.
- Continuous AI assistance during development.

## 🧩 4. Top Model-Based CLI Tools (2025)

| Tool | Developer | Description | GitHub Stars* | Strength |
|------|------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Gemini CLI** | Google | Open-source CLI for running Gemini models in the terminal. | ~81.4k | Excellent for AI workflows & agent extensions. |
| **Codex CLI** | OpenAI | Lightweight coding agent CLI for AI-assisted programming. | ~49.7k | Best for OpenAI ecosystem & editor integrations. |
| **Claude Code CLI** | Anthropic | Secure, enterprise-grade AI coding assistant for terminal use. | ~41.3k | Great for safe, enterprise environments. |
| **Qwen Code CLI** | Alibaba (QwenLM) | CLI for Qwen3-Coder models, supports multilingual coding. | ~15k | Optimized for Asian and multilingual developers. |
