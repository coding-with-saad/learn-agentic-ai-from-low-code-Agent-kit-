## 🧠 Introduction

**AgentKit** is OpenAI’s latest technology, launched in **October 2025**, designed to help developers **build, deploy, evaluate, and optimize AI agents** with less effort and more safety.

It combines multiple tools—**Agent Builder**, **ChatKit**, **Connector Registry**, **Evals**, and **Guardrails**—into one unified ecosystem for faster, safer AI agent creation.

> 💡 *Think of AgentKit as the "VS Code" for AI agents — everything you need to design, debug, test, and launch in one place.*

## 🧩 What is AgentKit?

AgentKit is a **developer toolkit** that streamlines the full lifecycle of AI agents.  
It works closely with OpenAI’s **Responses API** and **Agent SDK**, giving both visual designers and coders powerful tools for agent creation.

### Key Capabilities
- Visual drag-and-drop **Agent Builder**
- Plug-and-play **ChatKit** chat UI toolkit
- Central **Connector Registry** for APIs and data
- Built-in **evaluation and guardrails**
- Optional **Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT)** for continuous learning
