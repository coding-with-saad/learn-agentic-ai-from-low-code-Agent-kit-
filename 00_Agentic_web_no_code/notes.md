Chapter 1: Understanding the AI Revolution
1.1 Brief Theory Introduction
Artificial intelligence represents humanity's fourth great technological transformation, following steam power, electricity, and digital computing. Unlike previous revolutions that primarily automated physical tasks, AI augments human cognitive capabilities—our ability to think, reason, communicate, and create.

Key Concept: AI as Augmentation
Rather than simply replacing human workers, modern AI is designed to enhance human capabilities. Think of it as giving everyone access to a highly capable assistant who can help with research, writing, analysis, and decision-making.

The Platform Ecosystem Model
Throughout technology history, the most successful companies have built "platforms"—systems that allow others to create value on top of them. Examples include:

Microsoft Windows (a platform for software applications)
Apple iOS (a platform for mobile apps)
Amazon Web Services (a platform for cloud computing)
OpenAI is attempting to make ChatGPT a platform for AI-powered applications and services.

Infrastructure as Foundation
Just as roads, electricity grids, and internet cables form the infrastructure of modern society, OpenAI is building computational infrastructure (massive data centers and AI models) to power the next generation of applications.
